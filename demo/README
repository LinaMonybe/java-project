# Project - Rendu 2: Enhancing DAO

## Overview
This project refines the use of **(DAO)** for better separation of concerns in a Java application. I’ve implemented CRUD operations for key entities, created a generic DAO interface, and introduced a JDBC transaction manager to ensure data integrity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features
- **Refactored CRUD Operations** for the following entities:
  - User
  - Event
  - Room
  - Field
  - Reservation
- **Generic DAO Interface** for standardizing data access methods.
- **JDBC Transaction Manager** to handle multi-query operations and ensure transaction integrity.
- **JUnit Unit Tests** to validate DAO functionality.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Structure

- **dao**: Contains DAO interfaces and implementations.
- **model**: Holds entity classes (User, Event, etc.).
- **service**: Contains business logic.
- **main**: The application’s entry point.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

This project enhances the management of data access and transaction integrity in a Java application.
The use of generic DAOs and a transaction manager improves code modularity and maintainability.
